# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to review the upcoming group of employees eligible for retirement and their title/seniority level and how the team can fill the attrition. We will also look at the mentorship eligibility cohort and assess the gap and how to fill the senior titles and roles that are part of the retirement group. 

Results:
Over 50% of the retirement eligibility group are sr. staff and sr. engineers
The retirement eligible group makes up 30% of the entire employee population
The mentorship eligible cohort fills less than 2% of the retirement eligible cohort, a significant gap that needs a solution.
On the plus side, over 50% of the mentorship eligible group is either a sr. engineer or sr. staff.

Summary:
The company will need to fill over 90K roles in the upcoming 3 years for employees that are eligible for retirement. Fortunately, there are ample numbers of sr. employees in the retirement cohort who can serve as mentors for the mentorship program. However the company needs to cast a wider net for mentees as the numbers eligible is significantly smaller than the retirement cohort. 

mentorship program eligibility count => 1549
retirement eligibility count => 90398
total employee count => 300024
